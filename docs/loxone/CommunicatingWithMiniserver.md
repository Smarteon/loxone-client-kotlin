## **COMMUNICATING WITH** **THE LOXONE MINISERVER**

Date 2025.06.03


In order to modernize our interface, we improved our Miniserver, allowing it to communicate with


WebSocket clients that conform to the RFC6455. This document explains what is to be done, in

order to communicate with our Miniserver on the basis of an RFC6455 websocket. Parts of this

document will cover communicating via HTTP-Requests too (e.g. Secured Commands, Hashing or

the Structure File).


Arguments in commands are wrapped in curly brackets, e.g.: “jdev/test/{the argument}”. So when
{the argument} is “yeah” it will look like this: “jdev/test/yeah” - no more curly brackets here.

### **Important Notes**










# ! !



_Since November 2019, our new generation of the Miniserver has been_

_introduced. The new generation supports TLS Protocols such as WSS and HTTPS._

_For details see chapter Using HTTPS/WSS_


_As of Loxone Config 10.3 new hashing algorithms for passwords have been_


_introduced. Starting with future versions, passwords will be hashed using_

_SHA256. In order to ensure compatibility for future versions, please make sure to_

_follow the updated instructions listed here._

# ! !



_[As of Loxone Config 10.2 JSON Web Tokens (https://jwt.io/) have been](https://jwt.io/)_

_introduced. Using legacy tokens is still supported, but deprecated in version 10.2_

_and will be removed in future versions. In order to ensure compatibility for future_

_versions, please make sure to follow the updated instructions listed here._


_As of Loxone Config 9.3 password based authentication has been removed in_

_favor of token based authentication. Token based authentication has been_

_introduced in Loxone Config 9.0._


_Note: Using HTTP Basic Authentication for HTTP Requests is still available for_

_debugging and testing purposes. Since credentials passed along using basic_

_authentication may be intercepted and compromised, it is strongly recommended_

_to use token based authentication._


_This document has been revised and only contains info on token based_

_authentication. Please make sure your implementation is ready for tokens._

### Setting up a connection

#### **What do we need?**


  - [a websocket client implementation conforming to the RFC6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)

  - the IP or URL of the Miniserver (including the port)


      - beware, if the Miniserver is using the Loxone CloudDNS service, you need to resolve


it first. The websocket-redirect won’t work. (see CloudDNS)

  - valid credentials (user & password)

#### **Step-by-step guide**


Earlier versions of this document did cover password based authentication and authentication

without making use of encryption. This guide, however, is based on using encryption and tokens.


1. ensure the Miniserver is reachable


a. our apps are using an HTTP(s)-Request that returns both the Miniservers Mac
Address and it’s config version: “ **{ipOrUrl}:{port}/jdev/cfg/apiKey”**
b. Miniservers of our new generation will have an attribute “httpsStatus” in the


response, see chapter Using HTTPS/WSS for details.

c. Since 12.1 the response will contain a local-Attribute, providing insight on whether


or not the Miniserver deems this connection “local” (important for access

restrictions)


2. Acquire the Miniservers certificate via “ **jdev/sys/getcertificate** ”

a. Verify the certificate chain, and make sure it originates from the Loxone Root

Certificate


i. The root certificate is always the first certificate in the chain, but it should
be verified against a stored certificate on the client side!
b. Extract the Public Key from the last certificate -> {publicKey}


i. Store on the client

ii. X.509 encoded key in PEM format

3. open a WebSocket connection

a. use the following path: “ **ws://{ipOrUrl}:{port}/ws/rfc6455** ”


i. Note: WSS is supported for Miniservers of the second generation. See Using

HTTPS/WSS

b. specify “ **remotecontrol** ” as Sec-WebSocket-Protocol.

4. Generate a AES256-CBC key -> **{key}** (Hex)

5. Generate a random AES iv (16 byte) -> **{iv}** (Hex)


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 8 of 36


6. RSA Encrypt the AES key+iv with the **{publicKey}** -> {encrypted-session-key} (Base64)

a. “{key}:{iv}” is the payload that needs to be encrypted using RSA

b. This key and iv will be used to AES-encrypt messages on the websocket (e.g. for


authentication or token acquisition). More info on encrypted commands.
7. Pass encrypted session-key to Miniserver via “ **jdev/sys/keyexchange/{encrypted-session-**


**key}** ”

8. Generate a random salt, hex string (length may vary, e.g. 2 bytes) -> **{salt}**


a. This salt will be used to AES-encrypt messages on the websocket (e.g. for


authentication or token acquisition). More info on encrypted commands.

9. There are two options now:


a. If a token exists, then authenticate as described in Authenticating using tokens


b. If a token needs to be acquired, proceed as described in Acquiring tokens

10. After either successful token based authentication or acquiring a new token, the socket is


authenticated and ready to go.


Update the {salt} on your behalf, eg. After every sent command. This prevents replay attacks on


compromised websocket connections.


  - {cipher}: “nextSalt/{prevSalt}/{nextSalt}/{cmd}” encrypted with the session key (AES)

#### **What can go wrong?**


  - If you provide invalid credentials you’ll receive a message with the response code 401.

  - If you don’t authenticate within the first few seconds after establishing the socket


connection, you’ll receive a message with the response code 420 and the socket will close.

  - If you do not authenticate, but try to send any other command but the command required


to authenticate or acquire a token, you will receive a response with code 400.

  - If you are blocked due too many failed login attempts, the Miniserver will block you for a


certain time. The WebSocket closes right after it opens with a Close Code of 4003

  - Up to 31 concurrent clients can receive live status updates. The “hasEventSlots” attribute of


the jdev/cfg/api request indicates whether or not slots are available.

  - The connection attempt is made from an external connection, while only local ones are


allowed. Since 12.1 the jdev/cfg/api or jdev/cfg/apiKey responses will contain a “local”

attribute.

  - First generation Miniservers can serve up to 48 http connections, the new generation is


capable of serving up to 256 http connections. See Error-Code Section for details.

### Using HTTPS/WSS

Since November 2019 the new generation of the Miniserver is available. Unlike our Miniserver

Generation 1, the new generation allows for using TLS protocols such as WSS or HTTPS.

#### **Basic Info on HTTPS/WSS**


[HTTPS basically is HTTP, but TLS (Transport Layer Security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is used for communication. The same


is true for WSS and WS. For using TLS, servers must provide **a certificate** using which the client can

both verify the authenticity of the server and encrypt all communication transferred between them.


Our Miniservers use a certificate that is automatically obtained when using our CloudDNS service

(referred to as **CloudDNS-Certificate** here). Alternatively, you can upload your own certificate onto

your Miniserver using Loxone Config (referred to as **custom-certificate** here).

#### **What needs to be done to use HTTPS/WSS**


This document goes into detail on how to set up a connection using WS or HTTP, which is still

supported by Miniservers of the new Generation. Only little needs to be changed for making use of

HTTPS & WSS.


  - Use the TLS protocols HTTPS and WSS instead of HTTP and WS

  - Use the Hostname instead of an IP-Address


      - Certificates cannot be created for IP-Addresses, only for hostnames such as


“loxone.com”.

      - Connecting to an IP using TLS will result in certificate errors, as the authenticity


cannot be verified.

#### **How to determine if the Miniserver supports HTTPS/WSS?**


Especially when connecting to a Miniserver for the first time, it may not be known whether or not

TLS-Protocols are supported. There are different ways to find out, depending on whether or not

you are trying to connect locally or from the internet.


Ask the Miniserver itself


When connected locally, try a reachability check request such as
“http://{miniserverIP}/jdev/cfg/apiKey”. This request won’t transfer any confidential data, but will

contain an attribute “httpsStatus” which has the value 1 if TLS protocols are available, and a value

of 2 if the Miniserver has a certificate but its expired.


Ask our CloudDNS service


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 10 of 36


If a Miniserver supports WSS/HTTPS, the response described in the CloudDNS-Section will contain


two additional attributes “ **IPHTTPS”** and “PortOpenHTTPS”. These attributes are the counterpart for

“IP” and “PortOpen” for using HTTPS/WSS and are only available for Miniservers supporting TLS.


Trial & Error

If the Miniserver isn’t in the local network and the only info is it’s hostname (e.g.


my.smarthome.com:7777), the only option is trial & error. Launch a reachability check request
“https://my.smarthome.com:7777/jdev/cfg/apiKey” - if it succeeds, the Miniserver supports TLS
Protocols.

#### **What hostname to use with CloudDNS?**


As mentioned, certificates can only be created for hostnames and not IP addresses. To make a

connection using TLS the following steps need to be taken:


1. Request the current IP & Port from the CloudDNS

2. Create a hostname containing the IP and port returned by the IPHTTPS attribute of the


response.


a. Split up IPHTTPS into the {ip} and {port}


b. Clean up the {ip} → {cleaned-ip}


i. IPv4: Replace dots (“.”) with minuses (“-”)
ii. IPv6: Replace colons (“:”) with minuses (“-”) and remove the brackets (“[“ &

“]”) at the beginning and end.
c. Create hostname “{cleaned-ip}.{snr}.dyndns.loxonecloud.com:{port}”


i. {snr} is your Miniservers Serial-Number.
ii. E.g.: “200-12-14-24.{snr}.dyndns.loxonecloud.com:4523”

#### **How can I connect locally with TLS?**


As long as your Miniserver is capable of TLS and is using our CloudDNS-Certificate, you can. You

need to create a hostname just like if you would connect from the internet, but use your

Miniservers local IP and port. E.g. “192-168-1-47.{snr}.dyndns.loxonecloud.com:443”


If the Miniserver is using a custom certificate, connecting with it via it’s local IP will result in

certificate verification errors.

### General Info

In order to communicate with the Miniserver, a few things have to be known. This is a short textual

explanation of the communication, details can be found further below.

#### **CloudDNS**


You can request the current IP Address of your Miniserver using an HTTP Request:


_“dns.loxonecloud.com/?getip&snr={ SNR of Miniserver }&json=true”._ The Request returns the current

IP Address and Port of the Miniserver represented as JSON. Here is a list of the important attributes

in that response.


  - Code


      - 200 = everything okay

      - 403 = Miniserver is not registered with Loxone, CloudDNS disabled

      - 405 = Miniserver not reporting to CloudDNS

      - 409 = Unsecure Password in place, external access blocked.

      - 412 = port not opened


      - 418 = Denied, see responseJSON-Attribute for details

      - 481 = Miniserver could not connect to the remote connect service

      - 482 = Miniserver connection via remote connect was aborted due to a timeout

      - 483 = Miniserver makes a scheduled restart

  - IP


      - Current IP & port reported by the Miniserver (for WS or HTTP)

  - PortOpen


      - Indicates whether or not the port reported is open, indicates configuration issues on


the Miniserver

  - LastUpdated


      - Date & Time of the last IP update made by the Miniserver

  - IPHTTPS & PortOpenHTTPS


      - Not available for Miniserver Generation 1

      - See chapter Using HTTPS/WSS for details

#### **Remote Connect Service**


Since Version 11.0 Miniservers may be reachable externally via our Remote Connect Service. This

service does NOT work for Miniservers Generation 1, as it requires encryption.


Those miniservers will be accessible via our Cloud DNS service, on client side no changes are


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 12 of 36


necessary. Remote Connect only supports using HTTPS/WSS.


**Support for distributed data centers**


Since May 2021 the remote connect service supports distributed datacenters, allowing for faster

connection establishment on other continents, especially mainland china. The response to the

getIP-request (just like for CloudDNS) will contain the info on which data center to use for the


requested Minserver.


1. dns. **loxonecloud.com** /?getip&snr={msserial}

2. Retrieve “DataCenter”-attribute value


a. E.g. “ **loxonecloud.cn** ”

3. Retrieve resolved IP


a. E.g. “123.123.123.123:12345”

4. Establish connection using the data center retrieved in step #2

a. E.g. “https://123-123-123-123.{serial}.dyndns. **loxonecloud.cn** :12345/”

5. In future requests, make use of the retrieved data for faster connection establishment.

a. E.g. “dns. **loxonecloud.cn** /?getip&snr={msserial}”

6. Should a Miniserver unknown by a previously datacenter (Code 405), fall back to step #1

#### **Controls**


In the following document a “Control” is a Function/Block-Function like “Virtual Input”, “Virtual


State”, “Intelligent Room Controller”, “Sauna” etc.

#### **Commands**


The Miniserver will answer every command it receives, it will return a TextMessage as

confirmation. This message contains the command it has received, an HTTP-Status-Code as success


indicator and a value. The value is the info that was requested or the state after a control
command was executed - but beware, these are not fully implemented, so instead rely on the state

updates.


  - a control command looks like


“

      - _jdev/sps/io/{uuid}/{command}_ ”

  - all commands can either start with “ _jdev/_ ” or just “ _dev_ /”


      - _“jdev/”_ in JSON-Format (Beware, the answer will contain ‘dev’ instead of ‘jdev’)

      - _“dev/”_ delivers responses in XML-Format and is deprecated

#### **Encryption**


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 13 of 36


Available since 7.4.4.14


**Miniserver Generation 2 & Miniserver Compact**


Miniservers of our most recent generation are now capable of using HTTPS/WSS, so every

information transferred between the Miniserver and the client is encrypted without further steps.


Versions prior to 11.2.10.22: Please note, that some commands (e.g. GetToken, RefreshToken, ..)


require application layer encryption, even though TLS is in place.


**Miniserver Generation 1**


The hardware specifications of the Miniserver do not allow full featured SSL encryption, it would

put the CPU under too much pressure leading to delayed responses to events. In order to still be


able to send data to the Miniserver in a secure way (in addition to hashing), Command Encryption

was introduced.

#### **Secured Commands**


We have the possibility to use a “visualization password” for Controls (set in Loxone Config), those

passwords are added to the commands as described below:


1. request the visualization password from the user - {visuPw}

2. request a {key}, {salt} and the used hashing algorithm {hashAlg} from the Miniserver

(“ _jdev/sys/getvisusalt/{user}_ ”)


a. {user} = the user whos visu password has been entered
3. Create an {hashAlg} hash (SHA1, SHA256,..) of “{visuPw}:{salt}” -> {visuPwHash}

4. Create an HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 hash using the uppercase {visuPwHash} and the


{key} (see Hashing) - {hash}
5. send “ _jdev/sps/ios/{hash}/{uuid}/{command}_ ”


a. response has Code 200 if password was correct and command could be executed

b. a response with Code 500 means the password was incorrect


To check the entered visualization password without triggering a function the webservice
“jdev/sps/checkuservisupwd/{hash}” can be used.

#### **Hashing**


Login information is not sent as plain text, even across encrypted connections, but as hash. The

Miniserver also only stores a hashed version of the information, to ensure the raw information can

never be retrieved.


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 14 of 36


1. the key from the “ _jdev/sys/getkey_ ”, “jdev/sys/getkey2” or “jdev/sys/getvisusalt” responses are


hex-encoded and might need to be converted to ASCII before being used to create a hash.

2. create a hash from the desired text (user:passHash, visuPwHash, token) using HMAC-SHA1


or HMAC-SHA256 with the {key} received in the answer

a. To create ‘passHash’ & ‘visuPwHash’ use the hashing algorithm {hashAlg} that is


defined in the answer of the corresponding requests

3. encode the hash back to hex

#### **Tokens**


Tokens have been introduced in Loxone Config 9. They are used for authentication instead of

passwords. Tokens can expire, be revoked without changing the password - and they allow for a

much more refined permission handling. See separate section for details on how to handle tokens.


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 15 of 36


#### **Permissions**

Along with the introduction of tokens, a refined permission handling has been implemented. When

requesting a token, the desired permission is to be specified. For establishing connections, only

two permissions are important: the permission for the web (ID = 2) and the permission for the app

(ID = 4).


One of these two permissions must be specified when acquiring a token for communication

(opening a websocket or sending HTTP-Requests).


**List of permission bit-flags**

|Bit|Title|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0x00000000|None|Token used to authenticate with the Intercom Gen. 2|
|0x00000001|Admin|Administrative Right|
|0x00000002|Web|Short lived token, used for Web Interface|

#### **States**

In order to receive the states of sensors and actuators, state-updates need to be enabled on the

socket. This is done by sending “ **jdev/sps/enablebinstatusupdate** ” to the Miniserver. The Miniserver

will only publish the states of sensors and actuators that are used in the user interface.


After this command is sent, the client will receive large initial Event-Tables containing Value-,


Text-, Daytimer- and Weather-States. These Event-Tables contain the current states of all sensors

and actuators.


The client needs to store these infos for the time the connection is active, because further on the

Miniserver will only inform the client on changes to these states.


These states are always sent out as an UUID paired with some sort of value, using the Structure
File (see LoxAPP3.json) and the UUID you can find out what value belongs to which control.

### Understanding the messages

As mentioned in the chapter on how to setup a connection, messages sent by the Miniserver are

always prequeled by a binary message that contains a MessageHeader. So at first you’ll receive the

binary Message-Header and then the payload follows in a separate message.

#### **Message Header**


The message header is used to distinguish what kind of data is going to be sent next and how

large the payload is going to be. In some cases, the Miniserver might not know yet how large the

payload is going to be. For these cases a flag indicates that the size is estimated (see Estimated).

The header is sent as a separate data packet before the actual payload is transmitted. This way the

clients know ahead how large the payload is going to be. Based on this info, clients know how long


it’s going to take and respond accordingly (UI or timeouts).


**Structure of the Message Header**


The Message Header is an 8-byte binary message. It always starts with 0x03 as first byte, the

second one is the identifier byte, which gives info on what kind of data is received next. The third


byte is used for information flags and the fourth byte is reserved and not used right now. The last 4

bytes represent an unsigned integer that tells how large the payload is going to be.

|1st Byte|2nd Byte|3rd Byte|4th Byte|5th Byte|6th Byte|7th Byte|8th Byte|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0x03|Identifier|InfoFlags|rsvd|len|len|len|len|


```
typedef struct {
  BYTE cBinType; // fix 0x03
  BYTE cIdentifier;  // 8-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
  BYTE cInfo;   // Info
  BYTE cReserved; // reserved
  UINT nLen;      // 32-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
} PACKED WsBinHdr;

```

**1st Byte: fix 0x03**


**2nd Byte: Identifier**


8-bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)


The identifier byte is used to distinguish between the different kinds of messages

**3rd Byte: Info**


The 3rd Byte of the Header is used to provide additional information regarding the incoming

message.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Estimated|rsvd|rsvd|rsvd|rsvd|rsvd|rsvd|rsvd|



1st Bit: Estimated


In order to get fast info of how big the next incoming data will be, a Header with the Estimated-Bit

set, tells, that the given size is only estimated (eg. Gateway Miniservers, ..)


An Estimated-Header is **always** followed by an exact Header to be able to read the data correctly!


**4rd Byte: reserved**


**5th-8th Byte: length of payload**


32-bit Unsigned Interger (little endian)

The size of the payload, may be estimated. This info can be used to adopt timeouts etc.

#### **The actual messages**

**Text-Messages**


Text-Messages are supported since day one of WebSockets. They are handled by all WebSocket

implementations out there - so having a separate message-header telling there will be a Text
Message wouldn’t be necessary. But in order to stay consistent in our application protocol, we did


add it for those messages as well.


Text-messages are received as responses to commands, but our Structure-File and other XML- or

JSON-Files are sent as Text-Messages too.


**Binary Files**


If you download files (e.g. images, statistic-data) from the Miniserver, you will receive a binary file.

As mentioned before, files with text-content (e.g. the LoxAPP3.json) will be be delivered as a text
message, so you don’t have to decode it.


**Event-Tables**


Incoming events are always grouped as tables according to their type (Value, Text, Daytimer,

Weather). Each Event-Entry in these tables has it’s own UUID, so you can assign the values to the

correct Controls.


  - -> One actual message can contain multiple events!


Event-Table of Value-States

Value-States are the simplest form of a state update, they consist of one UUID and one double

value each, so their size is always 24 Bytes.


Binary-Structure of a Value-Event

```
typedef struct {
  PUUID uuid; // 128-Bit uuid
  double dVal; // 64-Bit Float (little endian) value

} PACKED EvData;

```

Event-Table of Text-States


Text-States are more complex since their size varies based on the text they contain. That is why they
do not only consist of an UUID and the text, but also an unsigned int that specifies how long the text

is.


  - The UUID-Icon is used by the “Status”-Control (see Icons)

  - If textLength is not a multiple of 4 then padding bytes are appended, that are to be ignored.

typedef struct { // starts at multiple of 4
  PUUID uuid;   // 128-Bit uuid
PUUID uuidIcon; // 128-Bit uuid of icon
  unsigned long textLength; // 32-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
// text follows here

} PACKED EvDataText;

```

Event-Table of Daytimer-States

Like Text-States, Daytimer-States do not have a fixed size, it varies on how many Daytimer-Entries

there are per Daytimer.


“nEntries” tells the number of daytimer-entries which the package contains.


Analog Daytimer: each entry does have it’s value
Digital Daytimer: an existing entry means “on”, no entry means “off”


Binary-Structure of a Daytimer-Event-Table
```
typedef struct {
  PUUID uuid; // 128-Bit uuid
  double dDefValue; // 64-Bit Float (little endian) default value
  int nrEntries; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian)
  // entries (EvDataDaytimerEntry) follows here
} PACKED EvDataDaytimer;

```

Binary-Structure of a Daytimer-Entry
```
typedef struct {
  int nMode; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian) number of mode
  int nFrom; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian) from-time in minutes since midnight
  int nTo; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian) to-time in minutes since midnight
  int bNeedActivate; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian) need activate (trigger)
  double dValue; // 64-Bit Float (little endian) value (if analog daytimer)
} PACKED EvDataDaytimerEntry;

```

Event-Table of Weather-States

If an active Weather-Abo is up and running, we also get Weather-State Updates.


Each Weather-Event-Table contains info about the up-to-dateness (in Seconds since 2009, UTC) of

the Weather-Information, the number of entries and the entries itself.


Binary-Structure of a Weather-Event-Table
```
typedef struct {
  PUUID uuid; // 128-Bit uuid
  unsigned int lastUpdate; // 32-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)

  int relativeHumidity; // 32-Bit Integer (little endian)
  double temperature; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
  double perceivedTemperature; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
  double dewPoint; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
  double precipitation; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
  double windSpeed; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
  double barometicPressure; // 64-Bit Float (little endian)
} PACKED EvDataWeatherEntry;

```

**The UUID**


The Miniserver uses UUIDs in order to uniquely identify controls, in- or outputs. That is why the

states that are published using Event-Tables have one UUID for each state, so that the values can

be linked to their controls. Each UUID has a fixed size of 128 Bit.


Structure-Files such as “LoxAPP2.xml” (deprecated) or the new, tidied up “LoxAPP3.json” are

providing the information on what UUID is related to what control, or to what in- or output. They
can be acquired by sending “data/LoxAPP2.xml” or “data/LoxAPP3.json” to the Miniserver.


Binary-Structure of a UUID

```
typedef struct _UUID {
  unsigned long Data1; // 32-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
  unsigned short Data2; // 16-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
  unsigned short Data3; // 16-Bit Unsigned Integer (little endian)
  unsigned char Data4[8]; // 8-Bit Uint8Array [8] (little endian)
} PACKED PUUID;

```

Converting a UUID to a string

```
CStringA str;
str.Format("%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x",
uuid.Data1,uuid.Data2,uuid.Data3,uuid.Data4[0],uuid.Data4[1],uuid.Data4[2],
uuid.Data4[3],uuid.Data4[4],uuid.Data4[5],uuid.Data4[6],uuid.Data4[7])

#### **Icons**

```

In general, icons are used for rooms and categories, but also for displaying states, as in the
“Status”-Control. UUIDs are already used to link states to controls and furthermore they are also


used to identify icons and link them to groups (rooms or categories), or “Status”-Controls.


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 23 of 36


**SVG**


Along with the release of Loxone Config 6.0 a new format for icons was introduced: “Scalable
Vector Graphics”, short “svg”. Previously the only image format supported was “Portable Network

Graphics”, short “png”. SVGs are image descriptions in XML-Format, they are not only scaleable

losslessly, but they can also be modified and animated.


**Where to get them, where to put them**


The structure file gives info what icon is to be used where. In new configurations you will mostly

find “svg”-Icons (e.g.: “00000000-0000-0020-2000000000000000.svg”). Since some Miniservers

might make use of customized icons, there will still be some PNGs out there, even with newer

Config-Versions. Those can be identified either by “.png” or the file appendix is simply missing (e.g.
“00000000-0000-0020-2000000000000000”).


Images can be downloaded over the WebSocket by simply sending the UUID plus the type to the
Miniserver. So “00000000-0000-0020-2000000000000000.svg” will return the SVG-File of this

image, while “00000000-0000-0020-2000000000000000.png” will return the same image as PNG.


Text-States only contain UUIDs for icons without specifying the format. The only way to identify

whether it is a PNG or an SVG is the response type given in the Message-Header when

downloading the Icon. If it’s an Text-Message, then it’s an SVG (since it’s basically an XML-File),

otherwise it’s an PNG and the Message-Header will indicate that it’s a binary file. So for all

“Status”-Controls try to download an SVG and later decide based on the response whether it is PNG

or SVG.


**Caching**


An icon is identified by an UUID per Miniserver. This UUID doesn’t change as long as the icon

remains the same, regardless if you’re connected locally or remote. So you can reuse the

downloaded icons locally and remote.

### Structure-File: LoxAPP3.json


The Structure-File was mentioned a few times before in this document, it is the central element for

creating a visualisation. It contains almost everything you need to know about the Miniserver.

#### **Download and caching**


The new structure-file can be downloaded by sending “data/LoxAPP3.json” to the Miniserver. Since


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 24 of 36


it’s a text-file, the Miniserver will respond with a Message-Header on the websocket accordingly.


The Structure-File has got a field “lastModified that contains a timestamp, this is the date when

the configuration of the Miniserver was last changed. So every time a connection to a Miniserver is

established, the first thing to do after the WebSocket is up and running is to check if your cached
version of the Structure-File is up to date. This is achieved by sending “jdev/sps/LoxAPPversion3”


to the Miniserver and comparing its response to the value of the “lastModified” field of your cached

Structure-File.

#### **More info**


For detailed information on the Structure File & the controls within please see the separate


document on the Structure File.

### Command Encryption

Available since 8.1


As mentioned in the introduction section on encryption, Command Encryption is a technique that

allows clients to encrypt commands that would usually be sent via plain text. It is based on

AES256 and [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for the AES session key exchange.


A few commands aren’t supported:


  - Images/Icons (.svg, .png, camimage)

  - Files (LoxAPP3.json*, fsget/fslist)

      - LoxAPP3.json is available - but only “enc” is supported, as encrypting the response


would cause a heavy CPU load on Miniserver Gen 1.

  - Statistic Files and Data



|RSA|AES|
|---|---|
|● ECB<br>● PKCS1<br>● Base64 with NoWrap|● CBC<br>● ZeroBytePadding<br>● Base64 with NoWrap<br>● 16 Byte IV<br>● 16 Byte Block size<br>● 32 Byte Key length|

#### **Step-by-step Guide HTTP Requests**





1. Acquire the Miniservers public key via “jdev/sys/getPublicKey” -> {publicKey}


a. Store on the client

b. Format: X.509 encoded key in ANS.1

2. Prepare your command -> {cmd}


a. If authentication is required, append it to the {cmd} as described in Authenticating


using tokens


3. Generate a random salt, hex string (length may vary, e.g. 2 bytes) -> {salt}


a. Note: This is not the {userSalt} retrieved using the getkey2-command.
4. Prepend the salt to the actual message “salt/{salt}/{cmd}” ->{plaintext}

a. Example for {cmd}: “jdev/sps/io/AI1/on”


5. Generate a AES256 key -> {key} (Hex)


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 26 of 36


6. Generate a random AES iv (16 byte) -> {iv} (Hex)


7. Encrypt the {plaintext} with AES {key} + {iv} -> {cipher} (Base64)

8. URI-Component-Encode the {cipher} -> {enc-cipher}

9. Prepare the command-> {encrypted-command}

a. “jdev/sys/enc/{enc-cipher}”


i. only the command itself is encrypted
b. “jdev/sys/fenc/{enc-cipher}”


i. The Miniserver also AES Encrypts the response (Base64)

ii. The mime-type is the one from the decrypted response

10. RSA Encrypt the AES key+iv with the {publicKey} -> {session-key} (Base64)

a. “{key}:{iv}”


11. URI-Component-Encode the {session-key} -> {enc-session-key}

12. Append the session key to the {encrypted-command} -> {encrypted-command}

a. “{encrypted-command}?sk={enc-session-key}”

13. Send the request!


a. This request doesn’t require credentials itself, the {cmd} may contain the


credentials if needed

14. The Miniserver will decrypt and process the command.


a. If it cannot be decrypted (invalid public key, unexpected salt change) it will return


401

15. The Miniserver will respond after the decrypted command was processed and return the


value & status code as with a regular command.

#### **Sending encrypted commands over the websocket**


1. AES-Encrypt the command using the key, iv and salt negotiated during the websocket


connection establishment “salt/{salt}/{cmd}” -> {cipher} (Base64)

2. URI-Component-Encode the {cipher} -> {enc-cipher}

3. Prepare the command-> {encrypted-command}

a. “jdev/sys/enc/{enc-cipher}”


i. only the command itself is encrypted
b. “jdev/sys/fenc/{enc-cipher}”


i. The Miniserver also AES Encrypts the response (Base64)

ii. The mime-type is the one from the decrypted response

4. Send the command & if needed (fenc) AES-decrypt the response using the {key} and {iv}


created when the connection was established.

### Tokens

Available since 9.0, Updated in 10.2


Clients initially acquire a token using the users password. This token is stored and used instead of

the password for authentication. The following section will go into detail on how to work with

tokens.


[In order to simplify authentication/verification throughout the Loxone Smart Home, JSON Web](https://jwt.io/)

[Tokens](https://jwt.io/) have been introduced in version 10.2. In order to avoid breaking changes, version 10.2

introduces new web services for acquiring and refreshing JSON Web Tokens and a separate web

service allowing to check if tokens are valid.


Acquiring, refreshing and authenticating with legacy tokens is still supported, but deprecated.

Support for legacy tokens will be removed in future versions. It is highly recommended to move to

JSON Web Tokens as soon as possible. Legacy tokens may be converted to JSON Web Tokens using

the new refresh token command.


Starting with version 11.2 it is not mandatory anymore to use Encryption when acquiring tokens.

But it is highly recommended when communicating with a Miniserver without a transport layer

encryption!

#### **Acquiring tokens**


Updated in 10.2


Acquiring a token is similar to password authentication in previous versions. Additionally to the
“key”, a “salt” is needed for acquiring a token. A token can be either acquired via HTTP requests or

via a websocket.


  - Acquire the “key”, “salt” & “hashAlg” at once using “ **jdev/sys/getkey2/{user}** ”


      - **{user}** is the username for whom to acquire the token.

      - The “salt” retrieved will be referred to as **{userSalt}**

      - “hashAlg” is the hashing algorithm that should be used

  - Hash the password including the user specific salt


      - **{pwHash}** is the uppercase result of hashing the string “ **{password}:{userSalt}** ” using

the in the getkey2 command specified hashing algorithm (‘hashAlg’, e.g. SHA1,

SHA256).

      - {userSalt} is part of the result of the getkey2-Request.


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 29 of 36


  - Create the hash that includes the user name


      - **{hash}** is the string “ **{user}:{pwHash}** ” hashed with the key returned by the getkey2

Request using HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256.

Do not convert the result to upper or lower case, leave it unchanged. For details on

the hashing process see Hashing

      - If you want to use a hashed token instead, the getparameter ‘tokenHash=true’ has


to be appended to the request. (Supported since version 12.2.10.6)

  - Request a JSON Web Token **“jdev/sys/getjwt/{hash}/{user}/{permission}/{uuid}/{info}”**


      - This request **must be encrypted** . Unencrypted getjwt requests will be declined with


400 Bad Request. See command encryption for more details.

      - **{permission}** specifies the permission this token needs to grant. This integer


impacts the tokens lifespan, e.g. a token with the web-permission (2) will last for a

short period of time, while a token with the app-permission (4) will last for weeks.

      - The **{uuid}** identifies the client who is requesting the token on the Miniserver. It


allows to look up all tokens a client has been granted. This is why the UUID should

either be derived from your devices identity information or generated automatically

and stored within the app. It has to be in the following format as this one:

“098802e1-02b4-603c-ffffeee000d80cfd”.

      - The **{info}** contains a (Url-Encoded) text describing the client, e.g.


“Thomas%20iPhone%20X”

      - As of version 12.2 you may use a token to acquire a new token. Required:


         - {hash} will then be a token-Hash instead of a password hash.

         - Append “?authHash=True” to the command


             - Tells the MS to check token hashes instead of password hashes.

  - Store the response, it contains info on the lifespan, the permissions granted with that token


and the JSON Web Token itself.


      - **{token}** is the JSON Web Token itself, it needs to be stored for authenticating.

      - {validUntil} represents the end of the tokens lifespan in seconds since 1.1.2009

      - {tokenRights} holds a bitmap, where a flag is set for each granted permission.

      - {unsecurePass} is set to true if a weak password is in place, it should result in a


prominent warning for the user, asking to immediately change the password.

      - {key} can be used for subsequent commands, just like a getkey-Result.

  - A websocket connection on which a token was acquired successfully is considered


authenticated.

#### **Authenticating using tokens**


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 30 of 36


  - Prepare the {hash}

      - **{hash}** is the outcome of hashing “ **{token}** ” along with the result of a getkey

Request using the HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. (see Hashing)

      - As of version 10.0 both JSON Web Tokens and legacy tokens may be used for


authentication.

      - Starting with version 11.2 the token can also be sent in plaintext instead of a hash

  - Prepare the {authCmd}


“

      - **authwithtoken/{hash}/{user}** ” for websockets

      - For HTTP-Requests “ **?autht={hash}&user={user}** ” is appended to the existing cmd.

  - Encrypt and send the **{authCmd}**


      - Details on encrypted commands via Websocket


      - Details on encrypted commands via HTTP-Requests

#### **Refreshing tokens**


Updated in 10.2


Tokens have a limited lifespan, depending on the permissions granted with them. When this

lifespan expires, tokens will no longer be valid. Refreshing a token will return a new token with the

same permissions and an extended lifespan.


When passing a legacy token to the new refresh token command, a JSON Web Token will be

returned instead.


  - Send “ **jdev/sys/refreshjwt/{tokenHash}/{user}** ” via websocket (HTTP support not verified)


      - **{tokenHash}** is the outcome of hashing the **{token}** with the result of a getkey

Request. (see Hashing)

      - {user} is the user whose token is to be refreshed

      - Starting with version 11.2 the token can also be sent in plaintext instead of a hash


This request will only succeed if the token is valid. If successful, the response will contain an

updated **{validUntil}** -value, an updated **{unsecurePass}** -flag and a new **{token}** attribute.

#### **Checking if tokens are valid**


Available since 10.0


This request was introduced to allow verifying a that a token is still valid, without renewing it as in

“refreshToken”.


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 31 of 36


  - Send “ **jdev/sys/checktoken/{tokenHash}/{user}** ” via websocket (HTTP support not verified)


      - **{tokenHash}** is the outcome of hashing the **{token}** with the result of a getkey

Request. (see Hashing)

      - {user} is the user whose token is to be refreshed

      - Starting with version 11.2 the token can also be sent in plaintext instead of a hash


This request will only succeed if the token is valid. If successful, the response will contain an

**{validUntil}** -value and an updated **{unsecurePass}** -flag. When changing passwords, this request can

be used to determine if the new password is secure, by checking the {unsecurePass}-flag of a

refresh-request afterwards

#### **Killing tokens**


Tokens can be explicitly invalidated (= “killed”) too. It is recommended to kill a token as soon as it

is no longer needed, as it helps keeping the Miniservers token storage clean.


  - Send “jdev/sys/killtoken/ **{tokenHash}** /{user}”


      - **{tokenHash}** is the outcome of hashing the **{token}** with the result of a getkey

Request. (see Hashing) {user} is the user whose token is to be killed

      - Starting with version 11.2 the token can also be sent in plaintext instead of a hash


A killed token will no longer be usable.

### Handling an active connection

#### **Keeping the connection alive**


The Miniserver has to watch over it’s clients and has to keep them all informed on everything that’s

changed. In order to prevent sending updates to clients that aren’t listening anymore, it will close

the connection if the client doesn’t send anything for more than 5 minutes.


To prevent this, while not having to constantly query a control or alike, there is a special command

called “keepalive”. Whenever a client sends this command to the Miniserver, it will respond with a

Message Header with the identifier 0x06. This command can be used to tell the Miniserver that the

client is still there and listens on the WebSocket.

#### **Detecting issues**

Our websocket is used for remote control. Mostly this is being done by apps running on smartphones


**16.0**


Communicating with the Miniserver                                    Page 32 of 36


that don’t always enjoy the best connection quality (poor carrier network, WiFi almost out of reach).
A poor or broken connection might cause that the user looks at old outdated data. E.g.: the app could
show that your garage door is closed, while it’s fully open.


By repeatedly sending out the keepalive-Request, the time between request and response (8 byte

Message-Header) can be used as an indicator for the connection quality. When the Miniserver

sends large messages this might lead to mistakenly detecting a connection problem, since


receiving the response might take a while. The payload size in the Message-Headers can be used

to adopt timeouts accordingly.

### Error-Codes

...Work in Progress

#### **General Info**


Error-Codes may be returned via HTTP-Header or as field “Code” in Results for a Requests.

#### **Returned Error-Codes**


   - 401
