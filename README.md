# Loxone Kotlin Client [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/cz.smarteon.loxone/loxone-client-kotlin/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/cz-smarteon-loxone/loxone-client-kotlin) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Smarteon/loxone-client-kotlin/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Smarteon/loxone-client-kotlin)
Experimental Kotlin implementation of the Loxoneâ„¢ communication protocol.

* *Supported miniservers*: miniserver gen. 1, miniserver gen. 2, miniserver GO
* *Supported firmware*: **10.4.0.0** and ongoing

Most of the library is trying to behave according to 
[Loxone API documentation](https://www.loxone.com/enen/kb/api/) 
and [Loxone webservices](https://www.loxone.com/enen/kb/web-services/).

For the detailed Loxone communication protocol specification, see the [documentation](docs/loxone/) which includes a markdown version of the official PDF.
  

*Disclaimer:*
This is an experimental project, which means:
* no further development is guaranteed
* there can be serious bugs 

Any feedback or help is welcomed.

The predecessor of this project is [loxone-java](https://github.com/Smarteon/loxone-java) library. For more complete experience on JVM, consider using it. There is a plan to merge both projects in the future in some way.
